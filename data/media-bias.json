         "description" : "\"The primary media outlets in every country are dominated by collectivists who believe it is their duty to filter or alter the news so the common man will have a \"correct\" opinion. Even those of us who are aware of this bias can fall victim to it if we have no access to the raw facts. In most cases, the truth is available even within mainstream media if one has the time to search for it. Unfortunately, that excludes just about everyone who is preoccupied with earning a living or raising a family. The function of these weekly summaries is to bring together in one place unfiltered news and commentary as an antidote to Newspeak.. There are no sports or lifestyles sections and no stories about the weather or crime or natural disasters. Aside from an occasional story about an amazing event or accomplishment, the only information you will find here is that which pertains to your freedom, health, and financial security, which is a lot..\" Excellent.",

DOI:10.1037/sah0000095\r\nResearch has consistently noted that news reports on mental illness are biased toward describing violent incidents, and there is evidence that the media is a significant source contributing to the public\u2019s knowledge about mental illness (Jorm, 2000). However, it is unclear whether and how the media\u2019s bias toward reporting violent incidents impacts one\u2019s assumptions about the association between mental illness and violence. Based on pragmatic inference, we hypothesized that people remember information that is not explicitly stated but plausibly implied from articles (Brewer, 1977). Thus, the mention of mental illness in articles describing violent incidents would lead people to infer a causal link between the two..

Inferring which\r\nnewspaper published a given article, based only on the frequencies with which\r\nit uses different phrases, leads to a conditional probability distribution\r\nwhose analysis lets us automatically map newspapers and phrases into a bias\r\nspace. By analyzing roughly a million articles from roughly a hundred\r\nnewspapers for bias in dozens of news topics, our method maps newspapers into a\r\ntwo-dimensional bias landscape that agrees well with previous bias\r\nclassifications based on human judgement. One dimension can be interpreted as\r\ntraditional left-right bias, the other as establishment bias. This means that\r\nalthough news bias is inherently political, its measurement need not be.",

Media owners have political motives as well as profit motives, and can influence public opinion by withholding information that is pejorative to their political agenda \u2014 provided that their agenda is not too far out of the political mainstream. This is true even with rational consumers who understand the media owners\u2019 biases, because the public do not know how much information the news organizations have and so do not know when news is being withheld. This problem can be undone by competition; but competition can be defeated in equilibrium by media mergers that enhance profits at the expense of the public interest. We thus derive a motive for media merger policy that is completely distinct from the motives behind conventional antitrust.",

         "abstract": "Online newspapers have been established as a crucial information source, at least partially replacing traditional media like television or print media. As all other media, online newspapers are potentially affected by media bias.This describes non-neutral reporting of journalists and other news producers, e.g. with respect to specific opinions or political parties. Analysis of media bias has a long tradition in political science. However, traditional techniques rely heavily on manual annotation and are thus often limited to the analysis of small sets of articles. In this paper, we investigate a dataset that covers all political and economical news from four leading German online newspapers over a timespan of four years. In order to analyze this large document set and compare the political orientation of different newspapers, we propose a variety of automatically computable measures that can indicate media bias. As a result, statistically significant differences in the reporting about specific parties can be detected between the analyzed online newspapers.",

         "pages": "5\u20136","abstract": "News media bias is commonly associated with framing information so as to influence readers judgments. It is not rare to find different news outlets reporting the same events under different perspectives with the intention to deliberately influence the reader. For example, making one side's ideological perspective look better than another. This may be an indication of a well known cognitive bias, the framing effect, which states that people may change their judgment based on how the information is presented (or framed). According to a 2017's survey from the Knight Foundation and Gallup, Americans believe that 62% of the news they consume is biased 1. Still according to the survey, there is a sharp divergence of bias perception across Republicans and Democrats regarding news organizations. This implies that the perception of bias may be affected by whether one agrees (or not) with the ideological leaning (when present) of the news source. How to expose such biases in an automatic fashion from textual content only? One way to do that is by comparing different news outlets on the same stories and look for divergences. In this talk, we present an investigation on news media bias in the context of Brazilian presidential elections by comparing four popular news outlets during three consecutive election years (2010, 2014, and 2018). We analyse the textual content of news stories in search for three kinds of bias: coverage, association, and subjective language. Coverage bias is related to differences in mention rates of candidates and parties. Association bias 2 occurs when, for example, one candidate is associated with a negative concept while another not. Subjective bias 3, has to do with wording that attempts to influence the readers by appealing to emotion, stereotypes, or persuasive language. We perform a thorough analysis on a large scale news data set where several such biases are exposed.",

         "abstractnote" : "Media bias is a worldwide concern. Although automated methods exist for the analysis of various forms of media bias, language is still an important barrier toward spotting worldwide differences in reporting. In this paper, we propose a methodology based on word embeddings, lexicon translation, and document similarity to assess media bias in news articles published in different idioms. We model media bias under the perspective of subjective language use, i.e., the more subjective the content of a news article is, the more biased it is.

These are users that are over-proportionally active in relation to the mean. By applying a geometric topic modeling algorithm (GTM) on German users\u2019 political comments and parties\u2019 posts and by analyzing commenting and liking activities, we quantitatively demonstrate that hyperactive users have a significant role in the political discourse: They become opinion leaders, as well as having an agenda-setting effect, thus creating an alternate picture of public opinion. We also show that hyperactive users strongly influence specific types of recommender systems. By training collaborative filtering and deep learning recommendation algorithms on simulated political networks, we illustrate that models provide different suggestions to users, when accounting for or ignoring hyperactive behavior both in the input dataset and in the methodology applied. We attack the trained models with adversarial examples by strategically placing hyperactive users in the network and manipulating the recommender systems\u2019 results. Given that recommender systems are used by all major social networks, that they come with a social influence bias, and given that OSNs are not per se designed to foster political discussions, we discuss the implications for the political discourse and the danger of algorithmic manipulation of political communication.",

The paper discusses crucial aspects of mediatised communication including reality, the presentation of reality as well as political and party bias. It will be argued that these factors can be incorporated in a theoretical model to assess bias and reality-related aspects of mediatised texts and their translations. The study will conclude by introducing a purely theoretical model, the Translation-centred Political Mass Communication Analytical Model, which facilitates the analysis of source and target texts used in the context of political mass communication.",

Yet economists still blame anti-globalists� demonstrations and public opposition to trade liberalisation on poor information. This paper analyses how the structure of the media industry affects the distribution of information on trade policy and globalisation. We present an empirical analysis of Belgian media reporting on trade policy and globalisation over the 1999�2002 period, supports these hypotheses and finds strong negative bias in media coverage. Moreover, we find that media coverage of trade policy and globalisation is highly concentrated around summit meetings of political leaders. Media attention in the popular press is heavily influenced by riots and demonstrations at summits. The paper points at important implications for public information on trade policy and globalisation and for economists.",

As a first step toward explaining this phenomenon, this study explores various factors that explain individual-level variation in media trust. One key factor appears to be trust in government, suggesting that the media\u2019s lowly stature may stem more from general political malaise than from the many shortcomings of contemporary news coverage. Interestingly, trust in the media is particularly low among conservative Republicans, especially those who listen to political talk radio. For these Americans, perhaps the problem with the media rests on what they see as a liberal bias, not declining journalistic standards.",

Beginning from this perspective, we analyze trust in government in twenty-seven European countries, testing the interactive relationship between citizens\u2019 policy views and media slant. Under the assumption that news media bias content in the direction of their audiences or are compliant with potential influence exerted by the government, we use Eurobarometer survey data to measure the effects of the ideological slant of newspapers and public television on trust in government. Our results show that the pro- or antigovernment slant of media outlets interacts with the individual ideological views of each citizen and confirm that media act like \u201Cecho-chambers\u201D that reinforce preexisting attitudes. Conversely, the consumption of counter-attitudinal information barely alters trust in government nor does it produce hostile media effects. We also find a slight difference between newspaper readers and public service broadcaster (PSB) users, which seems related to mechanisms of cognitive dissonance.",

Social media is a tantalizing data source for those who wish to monitor such signals. Unlike most prior work, we assume that the target phenomenon is known and we are given a method to count its occurrences in social media. However, counting is plagued by sample bias, incomplete data, and, paradoxically, data scarcity \u2013 issues inadequately addressed by prior work. We formulate signal recovery as a Poisson point process estimation problem. We explicitly incorporate human population bias, time delays and spatial distortions, and spatio-temporal regularization into the model to address the noisy count issues. We present an efficient optimization algorithm and discuss its theoretical properties. We show that our model is more accurate than commonly-used baselines. Finally, we present a case study on wildlife roadkill monitoring, where our model produces qualitatively convincing results.",

His analyses of particular media are commonly viewed simply as instances of his broader account of how space- and time-binding media serve to bias societies and civilizations. This paper argues that Innis' generalizations about media derived, in fact, from his examination of how a particular cluster of media \u2013 namely, printing and publishing, with particular reference to newspapers \u2013 was linked to the onset of modernity. These concerns were evident in his magisterial unpublished manuscript, History of Communication. Drawing on its periodization and overarching themes, this paper examines Innis' account of the newspaper industry as it developed between the American Revolution and the mid-point of the twentieth century. The historical trajectory that Innis traces, it is argued, reveals the specific concerns about printing and modernity that underpinned his general reflections about time- and space-binding communications",

On the down side, search engines bias the traffic of users according to their page ranking strategies, and it has been argued that they create a vicious cycle that amplifies the dominance of established and already popular sites. This bias could lead to a dangerous monopoly of information. We show that, contrary to intuition, empirical data do not support this conclusion; popular sites receive far less traffic than predicted. We discuss a model that accurately predicts traffic data patterns by taking into consideration the topical interests of users and their searching behavior in addition to the way search engines rank pages. The heterogeneity of user interests explains the observed mitigation of search engines' popularity bias.",

         "abstract": "That market forces drive the news is not news. Whether a story appears in print, on television, or on the Internet depends on who is interested, its value to advertisers, the costs of assembling the details, and competitors' products. But in All the News That's Fit to Sell, economist James Hamilton shows just how this happens. Furthermore, many complaints about journalism--media bias, soft news, and pundits as celebrities--arise from the impact of this economic logic on news judgments. This is the first book to develop an economic theory of news, analyze evidence across a wide range of media markets on how incentives affect news content, and offer policy conclusions. Media bias, for instance, was long a staple of the news. Hamilton's analysis of newspapers from 1870 to 1900 reveals how nonpartisan reporting became the norm. A hundred years later, some partisan elements reemerged as, for example, evening news broadcasts tried to retain young female viewers with stories aimed at their (Democratic) political interests. Examination of story selection on the network evening news programs from 1969 to 1998 shows how cable competition, deregulation, and ownership changes encouraged a shift from hard news about politics toward more soft news about entertainers. Hamilton concludes by calling for lower costs of access to government information, a greater role for nonprofits in funding journalism, the development of norms that stress hard news reporting, and the defining of digital and Internet property rights to encourage the flow of news. Ultimately, this book shows that by more fully understanding the economics behind the news, we will be better positioned to ensure that the news serves the public good.",

This, I argue, is what Innis accomplished. His early studies of Canadian economic history transcended conventional economics and laid the groundwork for a later political theory of communications. It expressly took up the 1946 challenge to address competing monopolies of knowledge and power, hence manipulating the space and time-binding properties of communications media. Innis' work reflected a materialist model of communications, a social ecology, a soft determinism or philosophic naturalism and it linked knowledge, freedom and power. Finally, I conclude, these insights permitted Innis to transcend bias and to search for a balanced culture.",

         "abstract": "A sediment sample (cylinder of 5.9 cm diameter) is prepared in the laboratory by reconstituting the marine quartz sands from the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Different regions of the cylinder are sub-sampled by smaller cylinders (each with 6.5 mm diameter) by digital computed tomography. These digitized images provide the porous matrix for an interacting lattice gas simulation. A cubic lattice of size $100^3$ is used to represent the sediment matrix of the order of\n$64 mm^3$. Each region of the reconstituted sample is represented by corresponding porous matrices each with a unique pore distribution. Mobile particles, the constituents of an interacting lattice gas, are used to model the fluid which flows through the porous media from a source at the bottom to a sink at the top. Fluid particles are driven by their concentration gradient and an external pressure bias against gravity. We study the variations of the root mean square displacement of each particle (tracer) and that of their center of mass with the time steps, mass transfer and flux with the time step.\nResponses of these physical properties are examined as a function of the external pressure bias. The linear and non-linear response (which varies among samples) of the particle flux density to the external bias are observed.",

         "number": "ID 3118471","abstract": "The spread of misinformation and disinformation, especially on social media, is a major societal challenge. Here, we assess whether crowdsourced ratings of trust in news sources can effectively differentiate between more and less reliable sources. To do so, we ran a preregistered experiment (N = 1,010 from Amazon Mechanical Turk) in which individuals rated familiarity with, and trust in, 60 news sources from three categories: 1) Mainstream media outlets, 2) Websites that produce hyper-partisan coverage of actual facts, and 3) Websites that produce blatantly false content (\u201Cfake news\u201D). Our results indicate that, despite substantial partisan bias, laypeople across the political spectrum rate mainstream media outlets as far more trustworthy than either hyper-partisan or fake news sources (all but 1 mainstream source, Salon, was rated as more trustworthy than every hyper-partisan or fake news source when equally weighting ratings of Democrats and Republicans). Critically, however, excluding ratings from participants who are not familiar with a given news source dramatically reduces the difference between mainstream media sources and hyper-partisan or fake news sites. For example, 30\\% of the mainstream media websites (Salon, the Guardian, Fox News, Politico, Huffington Post, and Newsweek) received lower trust scores than the most trusted fake news site (news4ktla.com) when excluding unfamiliar ratings. This suggests that rather than being initially agnostic about unfamiliar sources, people are initially skeptical \u2013 and thus a lack of familiarity is an important cue for untrustworthiness. Overall, our findings indicate that crowdsourcing media trustworthiness judgments is a promising approach for fighting misinformation and disinformation online, but that trustworthiness ratings from participants who are unfamiliar with a given source should not be ignored.",

Digital media technologies exert significant influence on the enactment of controversy in online settings, and this risks undermining the substantive focus of controversy analysis conducted by digital means. To address this problem, I propose a shift in thematic focus from controversy analysis to issue mapping. The article begins by distinguishing between three broad frameworks that currently guide the development of controversy analysis as a digital method, namely, demarcationist, discursive, and empiricist. Each has been adopted in STS, but only the last one offers a digital \"move beyond impartiality.\" I demonstrate this approach by analyzing issues of Internet governance with the aid of the social media platform Twitter.",

While the major problem may lie deep in our society, music information retrieval contributes to promoting diversity or may create unequal opportunities for artists. For example, considering the known problem of popularity bias in music recommendation, it is important to investigate whether the short head of popular music artists and the long tail of less popular ones show similar patterns of diversity---in terms of, for example, age, gender, or ethnic origin---or the popularity bias amplifies a positive or negative effect.\r\nI advocate for reasonable opportunities for artists---for (currently) popular artists and artists in the long-tail alike---in music recommender systems. In this work, I represent the position that we need to develop a deep understanding of the biases and inequalities because it is the essential basis to design approaches for music recommendation that provide reasonable opportunities. Thus, research needs to investigate the various reasons that hinder equal opportunity and diversity in music recommendation.",

The works of three authors are drawn upon in order to support the argument that while the denial of academic legitimacy to the conservative tradition exists and begins in the university classroom, it reverberates far beyond academia. The books addressed are \"The Conservative Soul: How We Lost It, How to Get It Back,\" by Andrew Sullivan, \"What's Liberal About the Liberal Arts? Classroom Politics and 'Bias' in Higher Education,\" by Michael Bérubé, and \"The Enemy at Home: The Cultural Left and Its Responsibility for 9/11,\" by Dinesh D'Souza. The importance of bringing conservative works to higher education curricula is emphasized.",

To deal with the growing amount of information on the social web and the burden it brings on the average user, these gatekeepers recently started to introduce personalization features, algorithms that filter information per individual. In this paper we show that these online services that filter information are not merely algorithms. Humans not only affect the design of the algorithms, but they also can manually influence the filtering process even when the algorithm is operational. We further analyze filtering processes in detail, show how personalization connects to other filtering techniques, and show that both human and technical biases are present in today's emergent gatekeepers. We use the existing literature on gatekeeping and search engine bias and provide a model of algorithmic gatekeeping.",

We compared the results of our current analysis of 14,925 articles published in 72 Web of Science-ranked communication journals from 2013 to 2017 with Lauf's earlier data. We found that most leading journals still publish articles almost exclusively from the developed world, and we found the same bias regarding the composition of journal editorial boards. Analysis shows a decreasing contribution of the U.S., while Asia and Western Europe greatly increased their participation, and developing regions are still underrepresented. Our research shows that the field is still deliberately dominated by Western articles in Western journals edited by Western editorial board members. Given this, we suggest that the international community of communication scholars develop strategies to expand common standards for a more balanced international contribution pattern.",

In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include:  the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;  the nature of the copyrighted work;  the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; &amp;  the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

Thus, we view the inclusion of ``quotations'' from existing print, visual, audio and audio-visual texts to be appropriate examples of Fair Use, as are reproductions of visual images for the purpose of scholarly analysis. We encourage authors to obtain appropriate permissions to use materials originally produced by others, but do not require such permissions as long as the usage of such materials falls within the boundaries of Fair Use.  The  International Journal of Communication  encourages authors to employ fair use in their scholarly publishing wherever appropriate. Fair use is the right to use unlicensed copyrighted material (whether it is text, images, audio-visual, or other) in your own work, in some circumstances. We consult the  Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Scholarly Research in Communication , created by the International Communication Association and endorsed by the National Communication Association, and you should too. If you have any questions about whether fair use applies to your uses of copyrighted material (whether it is text, images, audio-visual, or other) in your scholarship, simply include your rationale, grounded in the Best Practices, as a supplementary document with your submission.",

Orwell is well known for his dedication to freedom of speech and objective truth, and his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four is often used as a lens through which to view the fake news phenomenon. This paper will examine Orwell's diaries in relation to UNESCO's Five Laws of Media and Information Literacy to examine how information literacy concepts can be traced in historical documents. Design/methodology/approach This paper will use a content analysis method to explore Orwell's relationship to information literacy. Two of Orwell's political diaries from the period 1940\u201342 were coded for key themes related to the ways in which Orwell discusses and evaluates information and news. These themes were then compared to UNESCO Five Laws of Media and Information Literacy. Textual analysis software NVivo 12 was used to perform keyword searches and word frequency queries in the digitised diaries. Findings The findings show that while Orwell's diaries and the Five Laws did not share terminology, they did share ideas on bias and access to information. They also extend the history of information literacy research and practice by illustrating how concerns about the need to evaluate information sources are represented within historical literature. Originality/value This paper combines historical research with textual analysis to bring a unique historical perspective to information literacy, demonstrating that \u201Cfake news\u201D is not a recent phenomenon, and that the tools to fight it may also lie in historical research.",

         "number": "2020","abstract": "main objective of this paper is split in two parts. Firstly, it is needed to verify if there exists a cultural bias for data science in Spanish language. Secondly, we have to check how privacy data is controlled in apps, which use contact tracing techniques, and also electronic devices such as smartwatches. To carry out the first part of the study, we have investigated about datasets in English and Spanish language and its technical structure. As well as, it has been designed a database, used for demonstrating the cultural bias that exists between English and Spanish language. For the second phase, it has been explored themes such as smartwatches for minors, adding a comparative table of privacy about important consumption brands. Following the assessment, it is observed that there exists a cultural bias between Spanish and English language. In fact, the results shows that a 70% of analysed datasets are written in English. The lack of inversion in technological education is one of the reasons why Spanish speakers countries lack of an appropriate technological education. On 14 May 2020, the newspaper The Economist writes an article about the involvement of countries on technological innovation. These countries do not include Spain because Spanish inversion does not cover more than 1,25% out of the PIB total. Europe has been driven by achieving the objective of reaching, at least, 3% in 2020. So, Spain is lower than the European media. On contrary, there are other countries such as South Korea, Denmark, and Sweden, which the barrier of 3% is reached and even 4% . Consequently, it has negative effects for technological education for Spain. One proof of this is the results of the PISA index (Program for International Evaluation of Student), where Spanish obtain fewer qualifications in technology, science, and mathematics than the average of OCDE countries (Organization for economic Cooperation Development). Apart from Spain, Chile, México, and Columbia are also at the bottom of the list . Moreover, this paper shows data that warn us about the importance of safeguard our security towards the technological breakthrough. Centralizing decisions in collaborative and international organizations by applying: efficient, ethics and deontological strategies could be a possible solution.  ",

The purpose of this paper is to analyze query suggestion features of three search engines to see if these features introduce some bias into the query and search process that might compromise this trust. The authors test the approach on person-related search suggestions by querying the names of politicians from the German Bundestag before the German federal election of 2017.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Design/methodology/approach\r\n              This study introduces a framework to systematically examine and automatically analyze the varieties in different query suggestions for person names offered by major search engines. To test the framework, the authors collected data from the Google, Bing and DuckDuckGo query suggestion APIs over a period of four months for 629 different names of German politicians. The suggestions were clustered and statistically analyzed with regards to different biases, like gender, party or age and with regards to the stability of the suggestions over time.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Findings\r\n              By using the framework, the authors located three semantic clusters within the data set: suggestions related to politics and economics, location information and personal and other miscellaneous topics. Among other effects, the results of the analysis show a small bias in the form that male politicians receive slightly fewer suggestions on \u201Cpersonal and misc\u201D topics. The stability analysis of the suggested terms over time shows that some suggestions are prevalent most of the time, while other suggestions fluctuate more often.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Originality/value\r\n              This study proposes a novel framework to automatically identify biases in web search engine query suggestions for person-related searches.

This, I argue, is what Innis accomplished. His early studies of Canadian economic history transcended conventional economics and laid the groundwork for a later political theory of communications. It expressly took up the 1946 challenge to address competing monopolies of knowledge and power, hence manipulating the space and time-binding properties of communications media. Innis' work reflected a materialist model of communications, a social ecology, a soft determinism or philosophic naturalism and it linked knowledge, freedom and power. Finally, I conclude, these insights permitted Innis to transcend bias and to search for a balanced culture. /// En 1946, après avoir visité la Russie, Harold Innis remarqua que le temps était venu d'étendre l'étude de l'économie politique à l'analyse de la lutte pour la suprématie sociale entre les états, les églises et le commerce, ainsi que la compétition qui y est reliée entre les langues, les religions, les cultures et les médias de communication. Sous cet angle, ses études préliminaires de l'histoire économique du Canada l'ont conduit à dépasser l'économie conventionnelle, et formèrent la base de sa théorie politique des communications. Cela releva expressément les défis de 1946 avec ses monopoles compétitifs de connaissance et de pouvoir en manipulant les propriétés d'espace et de temps des médias de communication. L'auteur argumente que ceci refléta un modèle matérialiste d'analyse des communications, une écologie sociale, un déterminisme modéré, un naturalisme philosophique tout en reliant la connaissance, la liberté et le pouvoir. Finalement, l'auteur conclut que ces expériences permirent à Innis de transcender le biais et d'effectuer la recherche pour une culture équilibrée.",

         "number": "6","abstract": "In most people with low-grade gliomas (LGG), the primary treatment regimen remains a combination of surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy. However, the optimal timing of radiotherapy is controversial. It is unclear whether to use radiotherapy in the early postoperative period, or whether radiotherapy should be delayed until tumour progression occurs.To assess the effects of early postoperative radiotherapy versus radiotherapy delayed until tumour progression for low-grade intracranial gliomas in people who had initial biopsy or surgical resection.We searched up to September 2014 the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 8, 2014), MEDLINE (1948 to Aug week 3, 2014), and EMBASE (1980 to Aug week 3, 2014) to identify trials for inclusion in this Cochrane review.We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared early versus delayed radiotherapy following biopsy or surgical resection for the treatment of people with newly diagnosed intracranial LGG (astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, mixed oligoastrocytoma, astroblastoma, xanthoastrocytoma, or ganglioglioma). Radiotherapy may include conformal external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with linear accelerator or cobalt-60 sources, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).Three review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and risk of bias, and extracted study data. We resolved any differences between review authors by discussion. Adverse effects were also extracted from the study report. We performed meta-analyses using a random-effects model with inverse variance weighting.We included one large, multi-institutional, prospective RCT, involving 311 participants; the risk of bias in this study was unclear. This study found that early postoperative radiotherapy is associated with an increase in time to progression compared to observation (and delayed radiotherapy upon disease progression) for people with LGG but does not significantly improve overall survival (OS). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.3 years in the early radiotherapy group and 3.4 years in the delayed radiotherapy group (hazard ratio (HR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 0.77; P value < 0.0001; 311 participants; 1 trail; low quality evidence). The median OS in the early radiotherapy group was 7.4 years, while the delayed radiotherapy group experienced a median overall survival of 7.2 years (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.33; P value = 0.872; 311 participants; 1 trail; low quality evidence). The total dose of radiotherapy given was 54 Gy; five fractions of 1.8 Gy per week were given for six weeks. Adverse effects following radiotherapy consisted of skin reactions, otitis media, mild headache, nausea, and vomiting. Rescue therapy was provided to 65% of the participants randomised to delayed radiotherapy. People in both cohorts who were free from tumour progression showed no differences in cognitive deficit, focal deficit, performance status, and headache after one year. However, participants randomised to the early radiotherapy group experienced significantly fewer seizures than participants in the delayed postoperative radiotherapy group at one year (25% versus 41%, P value = 0.0329, respectively).Given the high risk of bias in the included study, the results of this analysis must be interpreted with caution. Early radiation therapy was associated with the following adverse effects: skin reactions, otitis media, mild headache, nausea, and vomiting. People with LGG who undergo early radiotherapy showed an increase in time to progression compared with people who were observed and had radiotherapy at the time of progression. There was no significant difference in overall survival between people who had early versus delayed radiotherapy; however, this finding may be due to the effectiveness of rescue therapy with radiation in the control arm. People who underwent early radiation had better seizure control at one year than people who underwent delayed radiation. There were no cases of radiation-induced malignant transformation of LGG. However, it remains unclear whether there are differences in memory, executive function, cognitive function, or quality of life between the two groups since these measures were not evaluated.",

         "volume": "8","number": "1","pages": "28-37","abstract": "Heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) is often considered the next major step in the storage industry: it is predicted to increase the storage capacity, the read/write speed and the data lifetime of future hard disk drives. However, despite more than a decade of development work, the reliability is still a prime concern. Featuring an inherently fragile surface-plasmon resonator as a highly localized heat source, as part of a near-field transducer (NFT), the current industry concepts still fail to deliver drives with sufficient lifetime. This study presents a method to aid conventional NFT-designs by additional grazing-incidence laser illumination, which may open an alternative route to high-durability HAMR. Magnetic switching is demonstrated on consumer-grade CoCrPt perpendicular magnetic recording media using a green and a near-infrared diode laser. Sub-500 nm magnetic features are written in the absence of a NFT in a moderate bias field of only μ0H = 0.3 T with individual laser pulses of 40 mW power and 50 ns duration with a laser spot size of 3 μm (short axis) at the sample surface \u2013 six times larger than the magnetic features. Herein, the presence of a nanoscopic object, i.e., the tip of an atomic force microscope in the focus of the laser at the sample surface, has no impact on the recorded magnetic features \u2013 thus suggesting full compatibility with NFT-HAMR.",

         "abstract": "The Web has evolved to a dominant platform where everyone has the opportunity to express their opinions, to interact with other users, and to debate on emerging events happening around the world. On the one hand, this has enabled the presence of different viewpoints and opinions about a - usually controversial - topic (like Brexit), but at the same time, it has led to phenomena like media bias, echo chambers and filter bubbles, where users are exposed to only one point of view on the same topic. Therefore, there is the need for methods that are able to detect and explain the different viewpoints. \r\nIn this paper, we propose a graph partitioning method that exploits social interactions to enable the discovery of different communities (representing different viewpoints) discussing about a controversial topic in a social network like Twitter. To explain the discovered viewpoints, we describe a method, called Iterative Rank Difference (IRD), which allows detecting descriptive terms that characterize the different viewpoints (answering the question: what is the viewpoint about?), as well as understanding why a specific term is related to a viewpoint (by detecting other related descriptive terms). The results of an experimental evaluation showed that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on viewpoint discovery, while a qualitative analysis of the proposed IRD method on three different controversial topics showed that IRD provides comprehensive and deep representations of the different viewpoints.",

         "volume": "2007","number": "2","abstract": "Editorial peer review is used world-wide as a tool to assess and improve the quality of submissions to paper and electronic biomedical journals. As the information revolution gathers pace, an empirically proven method of quality assurance is of paramount importance. The increasing availability of empirical research on the possible effects of peer review led us to carry out a review of current evidence on the efficacy of editorial peer review. We found few studies of reasonable quality, and most of these were concerned with the effects of blinding reviewers and/or authors to each others' identity. We could not identify any methodologically convincing studies assessing the core effects of peer review. Major research is urgently needed.\r\n\r\nBackground: \r\n\r\nScientific findings must withstand critical review if they are to be accepted as valid, and editorial peer review (critique, effort to disprove) is an essential element of the scientific process. We review the evidence of the editorial peer-review process of original research studies submitted for paper or electronic publication in biomedical journals.\r\n\r\nObjectives: \r\n\r\nTo estimate the effect of processes in editorial peer review.\r\nSearch strategy: \r\n\r\nThe following databases were searched to June 2004: CINAHL, Ovid, Cochrane Methodology Register, Dissertation abstracts, EMBASE, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews: ACP Journal Club, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed.\r\n\r\nSelection criteria: \r\n\r\nWe included prospective or retrospective comparative studies with two or more comparison groups, generated by random or other appropriate methods, and reporting original research, regardless of publication status. We hoped to find studies identifying good submissions on the basis of: importance of the topic dealt with, relevance of the topic to the journal, usefulness of the topic, soundness of methods, soundness of ethics, completeness and accuracy of reporting.\r\n\r\nData collection and analysis: \r\n\r\nBecause of the diversity of study questions, viewpoints, methods, and outcomes, we carried out a descriptive review of included studies grouping them by broad study question.\r\n\r\nMain results: \r\n\r\nWe included 28 studies. We found no clear-cut evidence of effect of the well-researched practice of reviewer and/or author concealment on the outcome of the quality assessment process (9 studies). Checklists and other standardisation media have some evidence to support their use (2 studies). There is no evidence that referees' training has any effect on the quality of the outcome (1 study). Different methods of communicating with reviewers and means of dissemination do not appear to have an effect on quality (3 studies). On the basis of one study, little can be said about the ability of the peer-review process to detect bias against unconventional drugs. Validity of peer review was tested by only one small study in a specialist area. Editorial peer review appears to make papers more readable and improve the general quality of reporting (2 studies), but the evidence for this has very limited generalisability.\r\n\r\nAuthors' conclusions: \r\n\r\nAt present, little empirical evidence is available to support the use of editorial peer review as a mechanism to ensure quality of biomedical research. However, the methodological problems in studying peer review are many and complex. At present, the absence of evidence on efficacy and effectiveness cannot be interpreted as evidence of their absence. A large, well-funded programme of research on the effects of editorial peer review should be urgently launched.",

         "description" : "An alarming number of Americans no longer trust the media to report the news fairly\u2014a serious problem in a democracy that depends so much on news organizations to inform its citizens. As a first step toward explaining this phenomenon, this study explores various factors that explain individual-level variation in media trust. One key factor appears to be trust in government, suggesting that the media\u2019s lowly stature may stem more from general political malaise than from the many shortcomings of contemporary news coverage. Interestingly, trust in the media is particularly low among conservative Republicans, especially those who listen to political talk radio. For these Americans, perhaps the problem with the media rests on what they see as a liberal bias, not declining journalistic standards.",

         "description" : "In recent years, the Internet has been playing a bigger and bigger role in people\u2019s work and life. Currently, we observed that not every website is user-friendly and profitable. More and more malicious websites began to appear and these malicious websites end angering all aspects of the user. This can lead the user towards economic classes, even some can create confusion over the management of the country. Detecting and stopping malicious websites has become an important control measure to avoid the risk of information security [10],[8], [7].Generally, the only entrance to the website is URL, which can be malicious URL.",

Detecting of the malicious URL is very important. Currently, detection of malicious web pages techniques includes black-list and white-list methodology and machine learning classification algorithms are used. However, the black-list and white-list technology is useless if a particular URL is not in list. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer model for detecting malicious URL. The filter can directly determine the URL by training the threshold of each layer filter when it reaches the threshold. Otherwise, the filter leaves the URL to next layer. We also used an example to verify that the model can improve the accuracy of URL detection.",
